The Destruction is Real (TDiR) level source files
===============================

This is **The Destruction is Real (TDiR)** level source files.
Most of the source code is written in COG, the scripting language used by the game.

## Important note

Here in this repository, these files were decompiled by opening `Episode/tdirlevel.gob` in a [Container Manager, a program from massassi.net](https://www.massassi.net/programs/gob/conman_09a.zip).

The other files contained in `tdirlevel.gob` are models and textures (inside these directories: `3do/`, `3do/mat/`, `mat/`, `ui/` ).

## Legal

Read the [LICENSE](./LICENSE) file.

The models and textures of `Episode/tdirlevel.gob` aren't included here. This is because we don't share and own the assets due to some media copyright issues.
